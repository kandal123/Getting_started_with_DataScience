Hello!
Irrespective of the field I end up into, my enthusiasm for space exploration has only increased as time passed by, 

After a bit of research, I came across an API from space-track.org ,
from which I was able to create a dataset of objects in the Earth's orbit (functional/non-functional) in the form of satellites and debris.

I did an Exploratory Data Analysis on the same and was able to derive some expected results, where I analysed the payloads released by all the countries and the timeline in which these payloads were launched!

Space Debris, as we all know is a highly problematic issue and a topic which should be discussed a lot provided that space organisations are putting a lot of efforts to develop commercial space travelling with the aim to begin civilisations on other planets.

I also analyzed the data on space debris and the countries responsible for the same where I found a bit of unusual results, the reason to which is not yet known.

Do upvote the code & the dataset if you find it helpful and I'll appreciate feedbacks on the same!

p.s : Will be updating my code as well as the dataset in due time, improving on a bit of irregularities I noticed while extracting the data.
